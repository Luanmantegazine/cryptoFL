## CryptoFL: Decentralized Federated Learning with Blockchain
This project implements a decentralized Federated Learning (FL) architecture where training tasks are coordinated by a blockchain-based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). It uses Solidity smart contracts to manage participants and jobs, the Flower library for the FL process, and IPFS for decentralized model storage.
